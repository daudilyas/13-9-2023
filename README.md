Today, I went to our website to look for introduction videos, but I didn't find many. I then told my boss that we need to find more people to interview, and he agreed. I started searching for more candidates, but I didn't have access to Facebook groups. My boss suggested that I talk to my other coworkers. I also had a meeting with one of my coworkers and learned about scheduling interviews.
